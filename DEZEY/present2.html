        Truth is.....What You Read In The Previous Section Wasn't The Present..Wink!!!!!!</h1>
        <p class="para">Dezey, if you ask me to write an entire website about you, I would, coz.....</p> <BR><BR></BR></BR>

        <h1 class="ILU">I LOVE YOU DEZEY <br>I REALLY DO.....</h1> <br><br>
        <p class="para">And I always will....But the question is,...... Do you feel the same way about me? Can I proudly say I'm in love with you when you don't love me back? <br><br>
        Even if you're asked by another person, can you boldly say "YES!!!" without thinking twice? All those are left for you to ponder on. I'm not doubting you. I've done my part as a friend, and I'm sure that you too are playing your own part. <br><br> Just bear in mind that...</p> <br><br>

        <h1>I BELIEVE IN OUR FRIENDSHIP......I BELIEVE IN BENZEY!!</h1>
        <p class="para">Remember <i><b>Benzey</b></i>, our friendship name?? As funny as it sounds, it means alot to me. <br><br>
        This name reminds me of you, of us.. Dezey and Ben.... Merged together to form <b>BENZEY</b>..... A name that describes us as Close..... Not even close, but <b>BEST FRIENDS</b></p> <br><br><br><hr>


        <h2>Well......I guess that's that.....</h2>
        <p class="para">That's a wrap of things. I really hope you loved the present. Don't worry, the website would be updated (that's if you loved it) <br>
        Thanks for Reading. <br><br>
        Have a Memorable 13th Birthday as you head into Senior Secondary School...... <br><br>
