        <h1>This Month Marks Our 7th Month Friendship Anniversary.... <br>
        But Most Importantly, Today Marks Your 13th Birthday</h1> <hr><br><br> 
        <p class="para"><br>Yep, the heading's true. Today marks your 13th Birthday, but the month of July marks our 7th Month Friendship Anniversary. I'm so excited, how about you?? But let's go down memory lane, shall we? <br><br> Do you still remember how we first met? We first saw in the Month of December, after my birthday. But we first met on Whatsapp. We got to know each other and later on, we became close friends in school. <br> <br>Three months ago (April) we celebrated 4 Months being friends. We exchanged gifts and showed our care and love for each other. <br> <br>
        We began meeting in school - on the stairs, in the hall, in your class and even at the premises. School didn't stop us from chatting late in the night, did it? Nope. <br> <br>
        Below are some notes I wrote: </p><br><br><br>

        <h1>I Wasn't Sure At First If <br>
            You Liked Me</h1> <hr><br><br>
        <p class="para">There was a period in our friendship when I asked you if you liked me, and you said you'll tell me in school. The next day, you said you didn't but you accepted the fact that we could become friends. Although i wasn't too glad, but I was happy that we were still friends. <br> <br>
        But from friends, we became close friends, now we're Best Friends, and we vowed always to be Best Friends no matter what happened.</p> <br><br><br>


        <h1>The "You Guys Don't Match" Saga</h1> <hr><br><br>
        <p class="para">One thing that pisses me off is when my classmates would begin to downgrade our friendship jsut because they are jealous of it. They say statements like, "you guys don't fit" or "you guys don't match". It has happened countless times, and I'm sure you're also sick and tired of your classmates saying the same thing. To be frank, I almost bailed on our friendship. Really! <br> <br>
        But I was told that you don't have to listen to your friends all the time. And besides, I really liked you at the time, but if I did listen to them by staying clear from you, then I would have been a big fool for: Missing my chances of getting the perfect girl and listening to the jealous messages of my friends.</p> <br><br><br>

            
        <h1>Beauty Is In The 'Eye of the Beholder'.... 
            <br> So True!</h1> <hr><br><br>
            <p class="para">You have several unique qualities: kind, caring, loving, smart, amazing, cool, and others, but out of them all, your <b>Beauty</b> stands out. You have a good complexion (fair), but it's your smile that brings out your inner beauty. One can be beautiful inside, but not on the outside and vice-versa, but you're both beautiful on the inside and on the outside. <br><br>
            You say I'm the 'cause of your beauty', and well it's partially true. My desire is to always make you happy, and what kind of friend would I be if you're not happy? <br><br>
            
            But there are some people (classmates of ours) who think that you aren't, probably because they dislike the fact that you're way more beautiful than them. I don't know why, but my wish is that it should stop, and hopefully, it would.... Someday!! </p> <br><br><br>

            <h1>We Share Common Interests</h1> <hr><br><br>
            <p class="para">We share the same interests..... We're both gamers, we love the color blue (same color as this page), we have the same fav artists, we like and dislike the same things and we both visualize ourselves still being friends in the future. <br><br> <br></p>
